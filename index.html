<h2>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
<p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), BeetGames legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>BeetGames may process your Personal Data because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We need to perform a contract with you</li>
    <li>You have given us permission to do so</li>
    <li>The processing is in our legitimate interests and it is not overridden by your rights</li>
        <li>To comply with the law</li>

<h2>Retention of Data</h2>    
<p>BeetGames will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
<p>BeetGames will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.</p>    

<h2>Transfer of Data</h2>
<p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If you are located outside Malta and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to Malta and process it there.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Data</h2>
<h3>Business Transaction</h3>
<p>If BeetGames is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>    

<h3>Disclosure for Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances, BeetGames may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>

<h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>BeetGames may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
    <li>To protect and defend the rights or property of BeetGames</li>
    <li>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
    <li>To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public</li>

<h2>Security of Data</h2>
<p>The security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Our Policy on "Do Not Track" Signals under the California Online Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h2>
